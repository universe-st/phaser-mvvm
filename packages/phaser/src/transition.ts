/**
 * Open/close motion: the fade a dialog plays when it appears and when it goes away (PLAN M8's
 * 开闭动效, generalised into a small runner any layer can use).
 *
 * The whole module is **pure logic plus one structural interface** — no Phaser import, not even a
 * type-only one — so the scheduling half is unit-tested in Node with a fake target
 * (`test/transition.test.ts`), the way `reveal.ts` and `back-plan.ts` are. The parts that need a real
 * widget are three methods wide (`alpha`, `scaleX/scaleY`, `setAlpha`, `setScale`), which a Phaser
 * `Container` already satisfies.
 *
 * Two decisions worth knowing before reading:
 *
 * 1. **Time comes from the caller.** `step(delta)` is fed the scene's own frame delta, not
 *    `Date.now()` and not a Phaser tween. A tween would have to be created and killed per dialog and
 *    would show up in the lifecycle counters (`tweens`), and wall-clock time makes the animation jump
 *    after a tab switch. The plugin already walks frames for the reveal pass, so transitions ride the
 *    same hook — and a paused scene freezes them instead of skipping them.
 * 2. **`'base'` endpoints.** A transition says "from 0 to whatever this widget's own value is", which
 *    is what makes the same spec work for the scrim (whose opacity is `scrim` option, not `1`) and for
 *    the dialog body. The runner captures the target's values when the run starts.
