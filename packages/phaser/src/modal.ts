/**
 * `ModalHost` — the overlay layer of a scene: the `Dialog` of this framework (PLAN M8).
 *
 * A modal is *not* a widget: it is a full-stage layer pushed above the page, so it needs three
 * things no single widget can arrange on its own:
 *
 * 1. **A place above everything.** The layer is the root's last child, and in a Phaser container
 *    that is what "drawn on top" means. `mount()` re-raises the open layers, so a page swapped in
 *    while a dialog is open cannot hide it.
 * 2. **A shield.** The layer carries a hit area over the whole stage and is set as the router's
 *    capture (`InputRouter#setCapture`), so a press that misses the dialog cannot reach the page (or
 *    the game objects) underneath. The scrim is the visible half of the same idea: a themed
 *    translucent rectangle that also swallows the click that dismisses the dialog.
 * 3. **A focus trap.** The layer is pushed as a new `FocusManager` scope
 *    (`trap: true`, `focusFirst: true`), so `Tab`, the arrows and pointer focus all stay inside the
 *    dialog, and the widget that had focus on the page gets it back when the dialog closes.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const dialog = this.mvvm.modal.open(() => {
 *   Panel({ width: 420, padding: 20, gap: 12 }, () => {
 *     Text('删除这一项？');
 *     Row({ gap: 8, justifyContent: 'end' }, () => {
 *       Button('取消', { variant: 'ghost', onClick: () => dialog.close() });
 *       Button('删除', { variant: 'danger', onClick: confirm });
 *     });
 *   });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The content lambda runs in its own UI scope (`runInUiScope`), so containers inside it nest
 * normally and nothing it builds attaches to the page's tree.
 *
 * Escape is wired through `FocusManager.onBack`, which the plugin points at `handleBack()` before it
 * falls back to the app's own `onBack`: a dialog gets first refusal on `back`, and a dialog that is
 * deliberately not dismissible *swallows* the key rather than letting the page act on it.
