/**
 * `FocusManager` — keyboard/gamepad focus for a widget tree.
 *
 * The manager owns a stack of *scopes*; each scope has one collection of focusable widgets (a
 * stable, ordered list built from that scope's root) and the single index inside that list that
 * currently holds focus. Everything device specific lives in `nav.ts`; everything pointer specific
 * lives in `input.ts`; this file decides *which* widget should be focused.
 *
 * Three rules shape the design:
 *
 * - the collection is the boundary: `focus()` ignores widgets that were not collected,
 * - only the **top scope** is live. `attach()` installs the base scope (the page); `pushScope()`
 *   layers another one on top (a modal dialog, PLAN M8) and suspends the one below — its widget
 *   keeps its place but loses the focus ring, so exactly one widget in the tree ever looks focused,
 *   and traversal cannot leave the modal,
 * - `popScope()` restores what the suspended scope had focused, when that widget is still there.
 *
 * The interesting algorithms are exported as pure functions (`collectFocusable`, `stageRectsOf`,
 * `pickDirectional`, `directionalTolerance`) so they can be tested with plain objects, without a
 * Phaser runtime; the scope stack is covered by `test/focus-scope.test.ts` with the same kind of
 * fakes.
