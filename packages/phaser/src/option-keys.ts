/**
 * The option audit: telling a caller that an option it passed does not exist.
 *
 * Widget options are flat objects — node-level `LayoutParams` (`width`, `padding`, …) mixed with the
 * widget's own keys (`text`, `variant`, `maxLength`, …) — and both `splitOptions` and
 * `splitWidgetOptions` move unknown keys into the params bag, where `normalizeParams` ignores them. That
 * is fine for the *design* (it is what lets one object be handed to any container), and terrible for the
 * *user*: `TextField({ maxlength: 8 })` or `Panel({ pading: 10 })` used to produce a control that simply
 * ignores the option, with no error, no warning and no log line. The guide even documented it as
 * "unknown keys are silently ignored", which is exactly the kind of trap this framework should not have.
 *
 * So every construction now checks the bag (development mode only, one warning per distinct key) and
 * says what it did not understand, with a suggestion when one is obvious.
 *
 * The matching is pure and lives here — no Phaser, no scene — so it is unit-testable in Node, and the
 * demo sweep is the other half of the gate: a page full of every option in the library must produce no
 * warning at all, which is what keeps {@link LAYOUT_PARAM_KEYS} and the widgets' own key lists honest.
