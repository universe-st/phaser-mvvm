/**
 * The contract between the layout engine and its nodes.
 *
 * `LayoutNode` is implemented by the Phaser adapter (`Widget`) and by the test harness. The engine
 * never reaches into a renderer: it only calls `measureContent` / `applyRect` and reads params.
 *
 * Two passes, always in this order:
 *
 *   1. measure — parent constraint flows down, content size flows up. Results are cached by
 *      (constraint, node revision), so an unchanged subtree costs one map lookup.
 *   2. arrange — the parent's content rect is distributed to the children, then each child is
 *      re-measured against its final (usually tight) constraint and `applyRect` is called top-down.
 *
 * Geometry is kept in sub-pixel units during layout; snapping to the device pixel grid happens
 * once, in `applyRect`, driven by `LayoutEngineOptions`.
 *
 * Container padding lives on the node itself (`layoutParams.padding`); the `ContainerLayout`
 * options never carry padding, so it cannot be applied twice.
